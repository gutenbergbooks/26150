<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<div class="figl">
<img src="images/001.png" width="80" height="80" alt="T" title="" />
</div><p class="cap"><span class="dcap">he</span> gathering together of the Proverbs of
Scotland has occupied the attention of
several collectors. The earliest work on
the subject which has been traced is that of Beaton,
Archbishop of Glasgow, who, about the time of the
Reformation, made a small collection. The definite
information which we have of this work is so very
slight, however, that it has been of little or no value
to subsequent collectors and writers on the subject.
The first collection of importance is the well-known
one made by the Rev. David Fergusson, minister of
Dunfermline, who was a contemporary of Archbishop
Beaton. Fergusson's collection, which numbered 940
proverbs, was, all circumstances considered, a very
commendable one; and it has served as a foundation
to the labours of subsequent workers in the same
field. The next is that of James Kelly, published in
London in 1721. This volume contains nearly 3000
proverbs, and is very carefully arranged, with notes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
and parallel illustrations. The collection of Kelly is
an able and valuable one, as he was perfectly conversant
with the subject of proverbs generally; but
we are compelled to agree with Motherwell, when he
says that this writer's rendering of the Scottish dialect
is "most barbarous;" nor do we wonder that it excited
the profound contempt of Allan Ramsay, who,
from his thorough knowledge of the Scottish vernacular,
was openly indignant at the reputation gained
by Kelly's work, and made a collection himself, which
was published at Edinburgh in 1763. In a sensible
but pedantic preface, which he addressed to the
"Tenantry of Scotland, Farmers of the Dales, and
Storemasters of the Hills," he states his reasons for
issuing a work on the subject, and strongly recommends
the use of proverbs, particularly among the
agricultural portion of the community. After alluding
to the work of Kelly as a "late large book of them,
fou of errors, in a style neither Scots nor English," he
goes on to say:&mdash;"As naething helps our happiness
mair than to hae the mind made up with right principles,
I desire you, for the thriving and pleasure of
you and yours, to use your een and lend your lugs to
these <i>guid auld says</i>, that shine with wail'd sense, and
will as lang as the world wags. Gar your bairns get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
them by heart; let them hae a place among your
family books; and may never a window-sole through
the country be without them. On a spare hour,
when the day is clear, behind a rick, or on the green
howm, draw the treasure frae your pouch and enjoy
the pleasant companion. Ye happy herds, while your
hirdsels are feeding on the flowery braes, you may
eithly mak yoursels maisters of the hale ware! How
usefou it will prove to you (wha hae sae few opportunities
of common clattering) when you forgather
with your friends at kirk or market, banquet or bridal!
By your proficiency, you'll be able, in a proverbial
way, to keep up the soul of a conversation, that is
baith blythe and usefou."</p>

<div class="bk3"><p>Nearly a hundred years elapsed before a new collection
appeared, although, during that period, many
editions of the works which we have mentioned were
brought out to supply the demands of a proverb-loving
public. In 1832, the collection formed by
Andrew Henderson was published at Glasgow. It is
based upon the previous books, and is a very extensive
one, although in arrangement it is defective.
This collection, which is more ample than the former
ones, has the advantage of an elaborate historical
and literary disquisition on the general subject, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
the form of an introduction by the poet Motherwell,
which is allowed to be one of the most interesting
and comprehensive papers on proverbs which has
yet appeared.</p>

<p>The present collection of Scottish Proverbs, the
first edition of which appeared in 1862, while it is the
most extensive and systematic that has yet appeared,
claims to be little more than a mere mechanical compilation.
It was suggested by the work of Henderson,
and has been carefully collated with it, and also
with the previous collections of Fergusson, Kelly,
and Ramsay. Large additions have been made from
various sources, such as the works of Sir Walter
Scott, Galt, Hogg, and other national writers, while
not a few have been picked up and registered as they
fell from the lips of friends and strangers with whom
the compiler came in contact.</p>

<p>Throughout the volume, a considerable number of
notes are introduced. These notes the compiler had
some hesitation in inserting, from a feeling that many
of them were mere literal explanations or illustrations,
conveying generally but a very poor idea of the
deeper meaning which the proverbs themselves are
capable of yielding; and also in deference to opinions
which have been expressed as to the propriety of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
adding notes to a collection of proverbs at all, as
every reader of intelligence is competent to put an
individual construction upon each, suited to circumstances;
while the very wide inferences and applications
which can be extracted from many of them,
render the adapting of a brief and satisfactory note,
in many cases, an impossibility. As it is, however,
little merit is claimed for them; and if they are found
to be of no aid in facilitating an interpretation, they
will, at least, tend to relieve the monotonous or
catalogue effect, so to speak, which is apt to be felt
by many readers when perusing works arranged in
alphabetical order. In all cases where the compiler
could adapt a quotation or parallel proverb, he did
so in preference to inserting an original note. To
apply a proverb from the collection, it is hoped that,
after all, the notes will be found no worse than "Like
a chip among parritch&mdash;little gude, little ill." A
simple but comprehensive Glossary is appended, containing
and explaining the meaning of the Scottish
words to be found in the book.</p>

<p>Of course, in a work of this nature, it is impossible
to prevent redundancies and repetitions; and when
it is mentioned that the gathering and arrangement of
the first edition of this little work occupied the leisure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
hours of six years, and a similar period during the
preparation of the present, it will be readily understood
that many of the faults are to be attributed to
the length of time which elapsed during its compilation.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the compiler begs to state that the
present edition of this little work differs very considerably
from its predecessor. Upwards of 2000 additions,
alterations, and corrections have been made
upon it, most of which he is of opinion are improvements;
so that the book is, practically speaking, a
new one. He has also to thank the members of the
press for the very flattering reception accorded to the
first edition, and hopes that the new one will be
found equally worthy of their commendation. To
several private friends, and very many total strangers,
he desires to express his acknowledgments for many
valuable hints and important additions. As he is
anxious that this collection should be as complete
as possible, he will be most happy to receive any
suggestion or addition which may occur to readers,
and would respectfully solicit such with a view to
their incorporation in a subsequent edition, should
such be required.</p>

<p>Do as the cow o' Forfar did, tak a stannin'

<div class="bq"><p>"A cow in passing a door in Forfar, where a tub of ale
had been placed to cool, drank the whole of it. The owner
of the ale pursued the proprietor of the cow for the value of
the ale; but a learned bailie, in giving his decision, decreed,
that since the ale was drank by the cow while standing at the
door, it must be considered <i>deoch an dorius</i>, or stirrup cup,
for which no charge could be made, without violating the
ancient hospitality of Scotland."&mdash;<i>Sir Walter Scott, Note to

thus:&mdash;The grain is emptied from the "peck"

<div class="bq"><p>"Two great clans fought out a quarrel with thirty men of
a side, in presence of the king, on the North Inch of Perth,
on or about the year 1392; a man was amissing on one side,
whose room was filled by a little bandy-legged citizen of
Perth. This substitute, Henry Wynd&mdash;or, as the Highlanders
called him, <i>Gow Chrom</i>, that is, the bandy-legged
smith&mdash;fought well, and contributed greatly to the fate of
the battle, without knowing which side he fought on;&mdash;so,
'To fight for your ain hand, like Henry Wynd,' passed into
a proverb."&mdash;<i>Sir Walter Scott, Note to Rob Roy.</i></p></div>

<p>Every man has his ain bubbly-jock.</p>

<p>Every man has his ain draff poke, though some

<div class="bq"><p>The two last sayings are similar in meaning, viz., that
every man has his imperfections or faults. The latter qualifies
the proverb by admitting that in some these appear
more prominently than in others.</p></div>

<p>Every man kens best where his ain sair lies.</p>

<p>Every man kens best where his ain shoe binds

<p>Naething to be done in haste but gripping fleas.</p>

<div class="bq"><p>In his introduction to Henderson's <i>Proverbs</i>, Motherwell
relates a humorous anecdote in connection with this proverb.
An indefatigable collector of "rusty sayed saws," a friend of
his, was in the habit of jotting down any saying new to him
on the back of cards, letters, &amp;c., and thrusting them into
his pocket. On one occasion he had an altercation with a
stranger at a friend's house. The quarrel becoming warm,
ended by Motherwell's friend excitedly handing the other (as
he thought) his card. On the gentleman's preparing to
vindicate his honour next morning, it occurred to him to
learn the name of his antagonist. On looking at the card he
found no name, but, in place of it, traced in good legible
characters, "Naething should be done in a hurry but catching
fleas." The effect of this was irresistible, and the result
an immediate reconciliation.</p></div>

on the loch. But when one, which had been brought to

he felt his way across the graves; but taking every hollow
interval for an open receptacle for the dead, he was heard
